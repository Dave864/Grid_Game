### How it Works
Each major piece of the game (the overworld, encounters, etc.) are handled in seperate scenes.
##### OverWorld
This scene loads the player avatar and handles player movement. This scene handles loading and deleting the sections of the world visible to the player.
### Bug Report
The game is not in a playable state. The game will only load the section of the world that the player is in. The player is unable to move around.
